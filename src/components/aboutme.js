                    Since I was young, electronics and technology intrigued me. I was always curious of the process and the mechanics that went into creating my smart phone, or my Play Station, or the websites I would browse. Upon finishing high school, I wasnâ€™t sure as to what my focus of study should be. 
                    Initially, I thought my passion was personal training and fitness. At the age of 17, I successfully created Optimal Health & Performance which is my personal training and strength coaching business. While I come from a disciplined fitness background and enjoy personal training, it never provided me with the challenge or satisfaction I craved. 
                    Although this was my first professional experience, I started to seek out other avenues to creatively express myself.
